# Benchtop pneumatic actuation apparatus with 8 output channels
## Hatton Lab @ the University of Toronto

This repository documents the benchtop pneumatic actuation system used in the Hatton Lab (Bio-Inspired Materials and Design Laboratory) at the University of Toronto.

The benchtop pneumatics system has been recently updated. Previous versions of the system are documented in another repository (https://github.com/sitruklaq/Hattonlab-Pneumatics).

## Repository structure
 - The **documentation** folder is currently largely empty but will contain general documentation for the system (i.e., code logic flow, list of serial commands, etc.).
 - The **components** folder is currently largely empty but will contain a list of all components bought for the system (excluding components that were fabricated in-house) and datasheets for the individual components.
 - The **code** folder contains both (1) Arduino code sketches that can be uploaded to the microcontroller to test system function or run the actuation control loop and (2) a copy of the serial code (in Python) used to send serial commands to the microcontroller from a PC.
 - The **circuits** folder is currently largely empty but will contain a circuit diagram for the system as well as circuit diagrams for subcomponents.
 - The **CAD** folder is currently largely empty but will contain copies of the CAD models for structural elements of the system.
